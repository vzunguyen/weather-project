# Weather Prediction Model Project
This folder contains the models for the project. These models will help predict the weather type and the electricity usage based on the given temperature.

## Models
- Classification Models help predicting the weather conditions: Rain, Clear, e.t.c.
- Regression Model (Polynomial Regression): Electricity predictions. 


## Template
This project is using template based on [Cookie Cutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/).

The origin of this template is from this [repo](https://github.com/daveebbelaar/data-science-template).
